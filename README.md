## Summary of it
The Smart Reading Assistant utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to condense long texts into concise summaries and highlight key information. It is designed primarily for students, researchers, and professionals who handle extensive readings or can be used by anybody who is in need of it. This tool aims to optimize reading sessions by extracting content for more efficient comprehension.

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Condenses long passages into brief summaries.
- **Key Point Extraction**: Identifies and highlights the main ideas within the text.

## Installation & Usage
*Instructions on how to install and use the application will be uploaded shortly!*

## Data Retention Policy
User privacy is very important. While the tool stores data allowing users to revisit previous summaries, all data is automatically deleted after a month of inactivity to ensure data minimization and user privacy.

## Roadmap
*Will be used for updates or improvements as I do this project*
